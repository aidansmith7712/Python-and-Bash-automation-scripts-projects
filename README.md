# Ops Automation: Timestamped Backups (Python) & Service Monitor (Bash)

Two small, production-style scripts for Linux:
- **Python:** timestamped file backup with recursion, retention pruning, and dry-run.
- **Bash:** systemd service monitor with health probe, safe restarts, `flock`, and syslog logging.

See `python-backup/backup.py` and `bash-monitor/monitor_service.sh` for details and usage.
